# Next Track

![Animatic](/media/next_track_boom.gif "Come on ride that train")

Train racing game. Built with a team of RIT students for [#TrainJam](http://trainjam.com) 2015. Go as fast as possible, but not so fast that you derail. Go as far as you can before the time runs out. If you make it to a station, you'll get extra time.

When using a gamepad, swirl the left stick in a circular motion to crank your speed up or down. When playing with keyboard, use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the throttle.
